# Volatility-prediction
This is a project i did back in my higher education level at Karatina University, which aimed to predict volatility of financial assets in the foreign exchange market. With an aim to ensure its not just in papers, soon it will be hosted and accessed in a website to help make better decisions on when and why to buy or sell assets
